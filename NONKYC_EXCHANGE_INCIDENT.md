# NonKYC.io Exchange Delisting - November 2024

## Summary

AIPG was delisted from NonKYC.io due to the exchange owner's unprofessional behavior and inability to communicate effectively.

## Background

During the Base migration, the exchange had previously closed legacy deposits but had reopened them without clear communication. When questioned about why legacy deposits were enabled again, the exchange owner responded unprofessionally and lashed out, leading to the immediate decision to withdraw all funds and liquidity.

## Delisting

Given the exchange owner's unprofessional conduct and poor communication, all liquidity and funds were pulled from NonKYC.io and AIPG was delisted. The exchange owner is incapable of maintaining professional relationships and effective communication channels.
