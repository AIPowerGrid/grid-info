# NonKYC.io Exchange Delisting - November 2024

## Summary

AIPG was delisted from NonKYC.io due to the exchange owner's unprofessional behavior and inability to communicate effectively when we reached out to report a bridge exploit.

## Background


When we reached out to NonKYC.io to report the bridge exploit and coordinate a response, the exchange owner responded unprofessionally and was completely unhelpful. The exchange had previously closed legacy deposits but had reopened them without clear communication. When questioned about why legacy deposits were enabled again, the exchange owner lashed out and acted like a douchebag, leading to the immediate decision to withdraw all funds and liquidity.

## Delisting

Given the exchange owner's unprofessional conduct and poor communication, all liquidity and funds were pulled from NonKYC.io and AIPG was delisted. The exchange owner is incapable of maintaining professional relationships and effective communication channels.
