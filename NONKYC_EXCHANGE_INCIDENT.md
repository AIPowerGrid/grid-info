# NonKYC.io Exchange Incident - November 2024

## Summary

An incident occurred with the NonKYC.io exchange involving a 51% attack on the AI Power Grid bridge that resulted in approximately 800k AIPG being maliciously minted on Base while still existing on the legacy PoW chain.

## Timeline

The attack occurred approximately 4-8 hours before being discovered. The attacker was offloading coins on Uniswap and potentially other exchanges.

## Response

Upon discovering the issue, immediate action was taken:
- Legacy AIPG deposits were immediately disabled on NonKYC.io
- Affected wallets were blacklisted
- All liquidity and funds were withdrawn from the exchange
- The exchange was instructed to keep only Base deposits enabled

## Exchange Communication Issues

The exchange had previously closed legacy deposits but had reopened them without clear communication. When questioned about why legacy deposits were enabled again, the exchange responded unprofessionally, leading to the decision to withdraw all funds and liquidity immediately.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Communication is critical** - Better coordination between the project and exchanges during major transitions (like the Base migration) is essential
2. **Exchange relationships** - Professional communication and coordination are necessary for maintaining exchange partnerships
3. **Security monitoring** - Continuous monitoring of bridge activity and Uniswap pools helped identify the issue quickly

## Current Status

- Legacy deposits remain disabled
- Only Base-native AIPG deposits are accepted
- Funds and liquidity have been removed from NonKYC.io
- **AIPG was delisted from NonKYC.io**

## Where to Trade AIPG

AIPG is available for trading on **Uniswap** on Base. For the most up-to-date trading information and liquidity, visit Uniswap and search for AIPG on the Base network.
