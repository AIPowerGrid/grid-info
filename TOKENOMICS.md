## Token Distribution

### Fair Launch Model

AIPG launched on December 10, 2023, with a commitment to fairness:
- ❌ No venture capital allocation
- ❌ No seed capital or pre-sales
- ❌ No pre-mining
- ✅ Fair launch for all participants
- ✅ Community-first distribution

### Distribution Breakdown

**Original PoW Mining** (~85M AIPG)
- Fair launch mining on Proof-of-Work blockchain
- Community miners earned tokens through GPU mining
- December 2023 - November 2025

**AI Worker Rewards** (Allocated from Treasury)
- Tokens earned by providing AI inference compute
- Distributed based on work performed
- Ongoing distribution model

**Staking Rewards** (~3M+ AIPG funded)
- Rewards for staking AIPG tokens
- Continuous distribution over time
- Manually funded by treasury

**Treasury** (~65M AIPG)
- Ecosystem development
- Marketing and partnerships
- Future staking rewards
- Community incentives
- Team operations

**Burned Tokens** (~15M+ AIPG)
- Old contract migrations
- Supply optimization
- Permanently removed from circulation

## Token Utility

### Primary Use Cases

**1. AI Inference Payments**
- Pay for AI services on the AIPG network
- Access to LLMs, image generation, and custom models
- Direct payment to worker nodes

**2. Staking Rewards**
- Stake AIPG to earn passive income
- No lockup period
- Continuous reward accrual
- Current staking: https://aipowergrid.io/staking

**3. Worker Node Incentives**
- GPU owners earn AIPG for providing compute
- Payment for useful AI inference work
- No wasteful mining - only productive compute

**4. Governance (Future)**
- Vote on protocol upgrades
- Propose ecosystem changes
- Participate in DAO decisions
- Influence development priorities

**5. Ecosystem Access**
- Premium features and models
- Priority access to new services
- Marketplace transactions
- NFT minting and trading

### Value Accrual Mechanisms

**Demand Drivers**
- AI service usage requires AIPG tokens
- Staking locks up circulating supply
- Worker nodes accumulate for operations
- Ecosystem growth increases utility

**Supply Constraints**
- Fixed max supply (150M cap)
- Minting permanently disabled
- Burn capability reduces supply
- Staking removes tokens from circulation

## Economic Model

### Token Flow

```
Users → Pay AIPG → AI Services → Workers Earn AIPG
                         ↓
                    Staking Pool
                         ↓
                  Stakers Earn Rewards
```

### Sustainable Economics

**Revenue Sources**
- AI inference service fees
- Marketplace transaction fees
- Premium feature subscriptions
- Partnership integrations

**Token Sinks**
- Staking (temporary lock)
- Burning mechanisms
- Treasury allocation
- Long-term holder accumulation

### Comparison to Traditional Models

**Traditional Crypto Mining**
- Wasteful proof-of-work hashing
- Energy intensive
- No productive output
- Inflationary token emissions

**AIPG Model**
- Useful AI inference compute
- Energy produces value
- Real services delivered
- Capped supply, deflationary potential

## Staking Economics

### Staking Mechanism

**Contract**: `0x3ED14A6D5A48614D77f313389611410d38fd8277`
**Model**: Synthetix-style continuous distribution

**Key Parameters**
- Minimum stake: 100 AIPG
- Lockup period: None (unstake anytime)
- Reward distribution: Per-second accrual
- APY: Dynamic based on TVL

### Reward Calculations

**APY Formula**
```
APY = (Reward Rate × Seconds Per Year × 100) / Total Staked
```

**Your Rewards**
```
Your Rewards = (Your Stake / Total Staked) × Total Reward Pool
```

### Staking Impact on Supply

**Circulating Supply Reduction**
- Staked tokens removed from active circulation
- Reduces sell pressure
- Increases scarcity
- Rewards incentivize long-term holding

**Example Scenario**
- If 30% of supply is staked (45M AIPG)
- Effective circulating supply: ~19M AIPG
- Increased scarcity drives value
- Stakers earn rewards on locked tokens

## Token Burns

### Burn History

**Old Contract Migrations** (~15M AIPG burned)
- Legacy PoW tokens burned during Base migration
- Old contract addresses consolidated
- Reduces total circulating supply

**Future Burn Mechanisms**
- Transaction fee burns (potential)
- Buyback and burn programs (potential)
- Community governance burns (potential)

### Deflationary Pressure

With minting disabled and burn capability enabled:
- Supply can only decrease or stay flat
- No new tokens can be created
- Burns permanently reduce max supply
- Deflationary model benefits holders
