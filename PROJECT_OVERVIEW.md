# AI Power Grid (AIPG) - Project Overview

## What is AI Power Grid?

AI Power Grid (AIPG) is a decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) that transforms idle GPUs into a permissionless, censorship-resistant AI utility. Launched on December 10, 2023, with a fair launch model (no VC, no pre-mine, no pre-sales), AIPG democratizes access to frontier AI capabilities by creating a community-powered alternative to corporate AI gatekeepers.

## Mission Statement

To democratize open-source and local generative AI, revolutionizing human creativity and productivity by breaking down the barriers created by big tech giants who lock powerful AI models behind expensive APIs and corporate control.

## Core Problem

Big tech giants control access to the most powerful AI models through:
- Expensive pay-per-token APIs
- Corporate gatekeepers who decide access and pricing
- Artificial scarcity around powerful AI capabilities
- Vendor lock-in and proprietary systems

Independent developers and creators are left paying premium prices for restricted access to frontier AI capabilities.

## AIPG Solution

AIPG creates a permissionless, decentralized network where:
- GPU owners earn tokens for providing useful AI inference compute
- Developers tap directly into distributed compute without corporate intermediaries
- No wasteful proof-of-work mining - only useful AI inference work
- Complete transparency through open-source code, models, and workflows
- Frontier AI power remains in the hands of the global community

## Key Features

### Distributed Worker Network
Transform idle GPUs into powerful AI nodes. Contributors earn tokens by running cutting-edge models - from gaming rigs to data centers, every machine strengthens the decentralized network.

### Smart Routing Engine
Intelligent algorithms instantly match AI requests to optimal worker nodes, considering model type, current load, and performance metrics for lightning-fast results.

### Token Incentive System
Earn meaningful rewards for powering real AI workloads. Every AIPG token represents actual value created through AI inference that serves real users.

### Open Source Everything
All code, models, and workflows live in the open, eliminating vendor lock-in and accelerating innovation through collective ownership and shared knowledge.

## Technology Stack

### Blockchain Infrastructure

- **Contract Address**: 0xa1c0deCaFE3E9Bf06A5F29B7015CD373a9854608
- **Decimals**: 18

### Distribution Model
- Fair launch with no pre-mine, no VC allocation, no pre-sales
- Tokens earned through AI inference work (not wasteful mining)
- Staking rewards for network participants
- Treasury allocation for ecosystem development

### Utility
- Payment for AI inference services
- Staking for network security and rewards
- Governance participation (future)
- Access to premium features and models

## Ecosystem Components

### For GPU Owners
- Run AI worker nodes on existing hardware
- Earn AIPG tokens for providing inference compute
- No specialized mining equipment needed
- Contribute to democratizing AI access

### For Developers
- Access frontier AI models without corporate gatekeepers
- Integrate via simple API calls

## Competitive Advantages

### No Wasteful Mining
Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, every computational cycle serves useful AI inference rather than arbitrary hash calculations.

### True Decentralization
Community-owned infrastructure with no single point of control or corporate gatekeepers.

### Open Source Transparency
Complete visibility into code, models, and operations - no black boxes or corporate secrets.

### Sustainability
Repurposed hardware and useful compute dramatically reduce environmental impact compared to proof-of-work mining.

### Global Access
Anyone, anywhere can access frontier AI capabilities or contribute compute resources.
